## 📊 Project Analysis Summary

### What I Found

Your ScrollFX project is **95% complete**! Here's what's already done:

✅ **Investigation Phase** - Complete analysis of SwayFX's SceneFX integration
✅ **Agent 1-5 Implementation** - All code written (46 files ready)

### Critical Finding

Your original `integrate-scrollfx.sh` script had **3 path issues**:
1. Agent 4 files missing `agent4/` prefix
2. `layer_criteria.c` path incorrect
3. Some paths inconsistent

## 🎯 Your Next Actions

### Immediate (Right Now)
```bash
# 1. View the quick action plan
cat /tmp/scrollfx-next-steps.md

# 2. Verify your WIP directory structure
cat /tmp/wip-directory-verification.md
cd ~/scrollwm-scrollfx-wip
ls -d agent*  # Should show agent1-agent5
```

### Today (1.5-2 hours)
```bash
# 3. Run the corrected integration script
chmod +x /tmp/integrate-scrollfx-corrected.sh
/tmp/integrate-scrollfx-corrected.sh ~/scroll ~/scrollwm-scrollfx-wip

# 4. Follow manual steps (script will tell you)
# - Edit meson.build (8 min)
# - Edit sway/meson.build (7 min)
# - Edit transaction.c (30-60 min)

# 5. Build and test
cd ~/scroll
meson setup build
ninja -C build
./build/sway/sway --version
```

## 🔍 Key Insights

### The Critical Transaction.c Issue

Your kit-v2 documentation correctly identified this, and I've reinforced it:

**❌ DON'T**: Replace Scroll's `transaction.c` with Agent 3's version
**✅ DO**: Add 3 specific code blocks to Scroll's existing `transaction.c`

**Why**: Scroll has unique animation and workspace scrolling logic that Agent 3's SwayFX-based transaction.c doesn't have. Replacing would break Scroll.

### Script Path Corrections

The original script had:
```bash
# Wrong:
copy_file "$WIP_DIR/include/sway/layers.h" ...

# Correct:
copy_file "$WIP_DIR/agent4/include/sway/layers.h" ...
```

The corrected script fixes all these issues.

## 📂 File Organization

Your WIP directory should look like:
```
scrollwm-scrollfx-wip/
├── agent1/  (27 files: config + 26 commands)
├── agent2/  (8 files: container/tree)
├── agent3/  (3 files: scene/output)
├── agent4/  (5 files: layer shell)
├── agent5/  (3 files: input)
├── investigation/
└── kit-v2/
```

If it doesn't, use the verification guide to check and reorganize.

## ⏱️ Time to Completion

| Task | Time |
|------|------|
| Verify WIP structure | 10 min |
| Run corrected script | 5 min |
| Edit meson files | 15 min |
| Edit transaction.c | 30-60 min |
| Build & test | 30 min |
| **TOTAL** | **1.5-2 hours** |

## 🎉 Success Criteria

You'll know you're done when:
- ✅ Build completes
- ✅ `scrollmsg blur enable` works
- ✅ `scrollmsg shadows enable` works
- ✅ Windows have rounded corners
- ✅ Shadows follow window moves
- ✅ Scroll's animations still smooth

## 📚 Where to Start

**Start here**: `/tmp/scrollfx-next-steps.md`

This is the most actionable guide with:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Exact commands to run
- Troubleshooting for each step
- Checklist format

**Reference these** as needed:
- `/tmp/scrollfx-status-and-next-steps.md` - Deep dive
- `/tmp/wip-directory-verification.md` - Pre-flight checks
- `kit-v2/TRANSACTION-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md` - Transaction.c specifics

---

**You're incredibly close to completion!** All the hard architectural work is done. You just need to:
1. Run the corrected script
2. Edit 2 build files
3. Add 3 code blocks to transaction.c
