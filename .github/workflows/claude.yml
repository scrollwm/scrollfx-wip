                        You are working on ScrollFX, which combines Scroll window manager with SceneFX cosmetic features.
            
            IMPORTANT: Always check CLAUDE.md for project context and guidelines.
            
            Key points:
            1. Scroll uses sway_scene_* instead of wlr_scene_*
            2. Reference code is in /references/ subdirectories (READ-ONLY)
            3. Always create report-{taskname}.md documenting your work
            4. Use investigation-*.md files for understanding integration patterns
            
            When analyzing code, be precise about which files and directories to examine.
