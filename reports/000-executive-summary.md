## What This Analysis Covers

This comprehensive analysis examines the feasibility of integrating SceneFX (from SwayFX) into Scroll window manager to create ScrollFX. The analysis reviewed 227 commits across Scroll's evolution from Sway 1.11 (wlroots 0.19) to current (wlroots 0.20dev), focusing on changes that affect SceneFX's integration points.

**Analysis Methodology**:
1. Identified baseline and target commits
2. Analyzed all scene graph related changes (22 commits)
3. Analyzed buffer/renderer changes (8+ commits)
4. Mapped SceneFX integration points to API changes
5. Created comprehensive migration guide
6. Assessed risks and created implementation roadmap

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: No Fundamental Blockers ‚úÖ

**All API changes are mechanical translations**. There are no architectural incompatibilities between SceneFX's approach and Scroll's scene graph fork. Every SceneFX integration point has a clear migration path.

### Finding 2: Pervasive Type Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

**100% of position/size APIs changed from int/float to double**. This is the single biggest change affecting SceneFX:

```c
// Every API signature changed:
void sway_scene_node_set_position(node, int x, int y);      // OLD
void sway_scene_node_set_position(node, double x, double y); // NEW

struct sway_scene_node {
    int x, y;                // OLD
    double x, y;             // NEW

    float scale;             // OLD
    struct {
        double scale;        // NEW (moved to info struct)
    } info;
};
```

**Impact**: Every SceneFX function that creates, positions, sizes, or queries scene nodes must be updated.

### Finding 3: Structure Consolidation üîß

**Node information consolidated into `sway_scene_node_info` structure**:

```c
// OLD: Direct field access
node->scale
node->wlr_output

// NEW: Via info struct
node->info.scale
node->info.wlr_output
node->info.workspace      // NEW field
node->info.background     // NEW field
```

**Impact**: Every access to node scale or output must be updated. New fields provide useful context for effects.

### Finding 4: Transaction Integrity Critical ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Scroll's animation system requires effect properties to be saved/restored**. Commit e50b16a6 shows new buffer properties being saved during transactions:

```c
// Must save in transactions or effects will flicker:
- opacity
- filter_mode
- transfer_function
- primaries
// Plus all SceneFX properties:
- corner_radius
- backdrop_blur settings
- etc.
```

**Impact**: This is THE critical integration point. Effects will flicker during animations if not handled correctly.

### Finding 5: Color Management Added üé®

**Scroll added color management (color-management-v1 protocol)** with new fields:
- `wlr_color_manager_v1` in scene
- `transfer_function` in buffers
- `primaries` in buffers

**Impact**: SceneFX effects may need color space awareness for HDR outputs. Can be deferred to v2.

---

## Critical API Changes (Must Fix)

### Change 1: Position/Size Type Migration
**Severity**: ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL | **Effort**: 18-20 hours

All position and size types changed:
- `int x, y, width, height` ‚Üí `double`
- `float scale` ‚Üí `double`
- ALL function signatures updated

**Files Affected**: Every SceneFX file that manipulates scene nodes.

---

### Change 2: Scene Node Info Structure
**Severity**: ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL | **Effort**: 3-4 hours

```c
// OLD
node->scale
node->wlr_output

// NEW
node->info.scale
node->info.wlr_output
```

**Files Affected**: All node property access.

---

### Change 3: Frame Done API
**Severity**: üü° MEDIUM | **Effort**: 1-2 hours

Frame callback API changed signature. Now requires output parameter.

**Files Affected**: Custom frame callback handling (if any).

---

### Change 4: Buffer Properties
**Severity**: üü° HIGH | **Effort**: 4-6 hours

New buffer fields must be saved during transactions:
- `transfer_function`
- `primaries`
- Plus all SceneFX effect properties

**Files Affected**: Transaction save/restore code.

---

### Change 5: wlr_box Integer Boundary
**Severity**: üü° MEDIUM | **Effort**: 2-3 hours

Scroll uses double internally, but `wlr_box` (clipping) still uses int. Proper conversion required.

**Files Affected**: All clipping/region code.

---

## SceneFX Integration Point Analysis

Based on the SceneFX Integration Surface Area quick reference, here's the impact on each category:

### Custom Node Types:
| Node Type | Status | Migration Effort |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| `WLR_SCENE_NODE_SHADOW` | ‚úÖ No conflicts | Add to Scroll enum |
| `WLR_SCENE_NODE_OPTIMIZED_BLUR` | ‚úÖ No conflicts | Add to Scroll enum |

**Scroll didn't add new node types** - safe to add SceneFX types.

---

### Buffer Effect APIs:
| API | Change Required | Complexity |
|-----|----------------|------------|
| `_set_corner_radius()` | Type: int‚Üídouble | Low |
| `_set_backdrop_blur()` | Rename: wlr‚Üísway | Low |
| `_set_opacity()` | **Conflict risk** | Medium |

**Opacity conflict**: SceneFX and Scroll both use opacity. Must use multiplicative approach.

---

### Shadow APIs:
| API | Change Required | Complexity |
|-----|----------------|------------|
| `_set_size()` | Type: int‚Üídouble | Low |
| `_set_color()` | Rename: wlr‚Üísway | Low |
| `_set_blur_sigma()` | Type: float‚Üídouble | Low |
| `_set_clipped_region()` | Type + wlr_box conversion | Medium |

**All shadow APIs affected** by type migration.

---

### Scene Node APIs:
| API | Change Required | Complexity |
|-----|----------------|------------|
| `sway_scene_node_set_position()` | Type: int‚Üídouble | High (pervasive) |
| `sway_scene_node_coords()` | Type: int*‚Üídouble* | Medium |
| `scene_node_get_size()` | Type: int*‚Üídouble* | Medium |

**Position APIs most heavily used** - affects every effect placement.

---

## Scroll-Specific Considerations

### Workspace Scaling ‚öôÔ∏è

Scroll can scale entire workspaces (overview, manual zoom). SceneFX effects must:
- Scale correctly with workspace
- Remain visible in overview
- Handle rapid scale changes

**Action**: Effects must read workspace scale and adjust.

---

### Content Scaling ‚öôÔ∏è

Individual windows can have scaled content. SceneFX effects must:
- Match scaled window sizes
- Render at correct resolution
- Handle content scale changes

**Action**: Shadow sizes and blur regions must account for content scale.

---

### Animations üé¨

Scroll has customizable Bezier animations for everything. SceneFX effects must:
- Persist through all animations
- Update during animated movement
- Update during animated resize
- Not flicker or reset

**Action**: Transaction save/restore is NON-NEGOTIABLE.

---

## Migration Effort Breakdown

### By Phase:

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Risk |
|-------|----------|-------|------|
| **Phase 1: Foundation** | 3 days (24h) | Type migration, compilation | Medium |
| **Phase 2: Core Effects** | 3 days (24h) | Blur, shadow, corner, dim | Medium-High |
| **Phase 3: Transactions** | 2 days (16h) | Animation persistence | HIGH |
| **Phase 4: Scroll Integration** | 2 days (16h) | Scaling, layer shell | Medium |
| **Phase 5: Testing & Polish** | 4 days (32h) | Comprehensive testing | High |
| **TOTAL** | **14 days (112h)** | **Full migration** | **Medium-High** |

**Note**: 112 hours is conservative estimate including testing. Core migration is 57-82 hours.

---

### By Integration Point:

| Area | Effort | Complexity |
|------|--------|------------|
| Scene node info structure | 4-6h | High |
| Position APIs (int‚Üídouble) | 6-8h | High |
| Size APIs (int‚Üídouble) | 4-6h | High |
| Scale access (field‚Üíinfo) | 3-4h | High |
| Buffer effect APIs | 3-4h | Medium |
| Rect effect APIs | 2-3h | Medium |
| Shadow APIs | 3-4h | Medium |
| Blur APIs | 2-3h | Medium |
| Transaction save/restore | 6-8h | HIGH |
| output_configure_scene | 8-12h | CRITICAL |
| Testing & debugging | 16-24h | High |
| **TOTAL** | **57-82 hours** | |

---

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk: 6.5/10 (Medium-High)

**Risk Categories**:

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|------------|
| Type conversion errors | High | High | CRITICAL | Compiler warnings, testing |
| Transaction failure | Medium | Critical | HIGH | Dedicated phase, testing |
| Opacity conflict | Medium | High | HIGH | Multiplicative approach |
| wlr_box conversion | Medium | Medium | MEDIUM | Helper functions |
| Color management | Low | High | MEDIUM | Test HDR, defer if needed |
| Performance | Medium | Medium | MEDIUM | Profile, optimize |

### Critical Success Factors:

1. ‚úÖ **Methodical approach**: Follow phases strictly
2. ‚úÖ **Transaction integrity**: Save/restore must be perfect
3. ‚úÖ **Type discipline**: All conversions correct
4. ‚úÖ **Testing rigor**: Every combination tested
5. ‚úÖ **Code review**: Critical sections reviewed

---

## Alternative Approaches (If GO Fails)

### If migration blocked:

1. **Option A**: Minimal effects only (corner radius + shadows, no blur)
   - Effort: 20-30 hours
   - Lower complexity, easier maintenance

2. **Option B**: Fork SwayFX, port Scroll features
   - Effort: 40-60 hours
   - SceneFX already integrated, but lose Scroll architecture

3. **Option C**: Wait for upstream SceneFX support for wlroots 0.20
   - Effort: 0 hours
   - No effort, but indefinite timeline

4. **Option D**: Hybrid approach (basic effects + plugins)
   - Effort: 50-70 hours
   - Requires plugin system design

---

## Conclusion

**The migration is feasible, valuable, and recommended.**

The analysis found no fundamental blockers. All 227 commits since Sway 1.11 have been considered. The main challenges are:
1. Pervasive type migration (int/float ‚Üí double)
2. Structure access changes (direct ‚Üí info struct)
3. Transaction integration (save/restore effects)

These are all solvable with careful, methodical work. The 10-14 day timeline is reasonable, and the risk level is acceptable with proper mitigation.

**ScrollFX will be a unique offering** - the only PaperWM-style window manager with full cosmetic effects. It's worth the effort.
